WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
The outcome was never in our favor, Gary.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.560
Cut it to me straight, Hugh.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.520
What are my chances of getting out of this mess?

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.520
In your current state, you will pass the point of recovery in ten minutes.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.520
You are also leaking O2, Gary.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.520
Huh, look at that.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.520
They went with green for a red alert.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.520
I mean, I would have went with red.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.520
A periwinkle.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.520
Heck, I mean, even eight-nog.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.520
I don't even know if that's a color, but oh, good lord, now I just want eight-nog.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.520
The rate of the leak will render you lifeless in nine minutes.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.520
You are really buttering me up with fantastic news.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.520
I'm afraid, Gary, there is no foreseeable outcome where you survive.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.520
These tickets suck.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.520
Right in the nosebleeds.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:44.520
Good morning, Gary.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.520
Day one thousand eight hundred eighteen.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.520
How about freaking no?

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.520
That was a bit harder than normal, Hugh.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.520
Hello, dear friend.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.520
It's been a while.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.520
Hank!

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.520
Yes, what's up, Hank?

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.520
Bad news?

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.520
Yeah, Beth is looking good today.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.520
Look at that.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.520
Staring at me with those hot eyes.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.520
You, me, later.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.520
Cards, Hank?

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.520
You wanna play?

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.520
I need somebody to play with.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.520
Is there... it's gonna be you.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.520
I'm starting to run out of decks, Hank.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.520
Hey, Gary, hello.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.520
Ooh, cookie.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.520
Yummy.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.520
Hugh?

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.520
Yes, Gary?

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.520
Can I have a cookie?

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.520
No, Gary.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.520
Why not?

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.520
You opened it for Kevin.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.520
That sack of wet turds can't even eat cookies.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.520
He just smashes it into his processor slot.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.520
I hate Kevin!

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.520
So painfully.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.520
He's the blood of my life.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.520
If you take a cookie, I will be forced to add one full day to your sentence.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.520
You think a full day scares the captain?

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.520
Gary, I've explained this to you every day for the past five years.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.520
You are not the captain.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.520
You are a prisoner aboard this ship.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.520
Sounds vaguely familiar.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.520
Now open this cabinet.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.520
Oh, they're just so good.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.520
One day has been added to your sentence.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.520
I touched one! The captain's touched one!

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.520
Captain's log, 80085.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.520
Hey, Quinn! Guess who?

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.520
It's me, Gary, again.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.520
Quinn, I've thought on it, and I've decided that since this is the big day,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.520
the day of our anniversary, as you know, it's time to get real.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.520
Quinn, this, this is the real, raw Gary.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.520
It's been eating me up inside, keeping the real, raw Gary from you.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.520
For five years, real, raw Gary hasn't been able to get you out of his mind forges.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.520
When I met you that day, I knew you were it.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.520
Give us what's ours, Gary!

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.520
Technically, it's mine!

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.520
Dr. Bluestein and Derek!

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.520
Lose some weight! Come on, Derek, keep up!

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.520
They gave me a seltzer?

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.520
Why would they give me a seltzer?

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.520
Unless I ordered it. Did I order it?

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.520
Yes, I did.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.520
I'm gonna break your neck, Gary.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:49.520
Sweet heavenly fire, who is the muy bueno super spicy lady?

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.520
Captain Quinn Ergon, but don't bother.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.520
If you're not Infinity Guard, she's not interested.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.520
Actually, I'm pretty freaking high up in the command chain.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.520
Really?

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.520
Yeah, really.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.520
Seriously?

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.520
Seriously. I can't get any closer to your face, dude.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.520
Then where's your uniform, bud?

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.520
I have one, guy.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.520
No, you don't, pal.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.520
I do, Tom. It's in the bathroom.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.520
Crap!

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.520
Looking good, Gary.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.520
You're just gonna leave him in there.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.520
Chook chook, chook chook face.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.520
Oh, sweet aspirin.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.520
Three drapenoids, exact change.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.520
Take!

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.520
Take!

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.520
Swallow!

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.520
You're a good guy, Gary.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.520
Now to be smooth as...

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.520
First time I got a girl's number before I even said hey.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.520
You see, I like that. I like a girl with a lot of phones.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.520
Actually, this is the solution to an internal inconsistency in Plank's constant that's never been solved

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.520
because until now, no one realized it was a problem.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.520
And speaking of problems, maybe you should leave before you become one.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.520
As in now.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.520
Or I could buy you a drink.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.520
Really?

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.520
Let's get wild. How about you buy me a drink?

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.520
Wow. I mean, no, but wow.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.520
All Infinity Guards report back to base immediately.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.520
Let's go!

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.520
Back to your place? You're moving at cheetah speeds. I like it.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.520
You have an F71 Hawk to fly, pilot.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.520
Oh my crap.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.520
Move this Hawk, pilot.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.520
You can do this, Gary. Become a much smarter person now.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.520
Oh my double crap!

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.520
You're not a pilot, are you?

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.520
Yes, I am.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.520
Bitch!

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.520
Lesson learned. If you ever want to piss off a whole government,

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.520
just take out 92 Starquizzers in a small, family-owned Mexican restaurant.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.520
Sorry, Guadalupe.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.520
Hey, Gary, my name is Kevin. I'm your deep space insanity avoidance companion.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.520
Nice to meet you.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.520
I already hate you.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.520
The good news is I only have a week left to my sentence aboard this pathetic rat's nest.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.520
Incend!

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.520
She's gonna respond this time, Hugh.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.520
There is a high probability she will not.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.520
But there's still a low probability she will.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.520
I'll take it.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.520
Ha ha ha ha ha! Nailed it!

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.520
There are still four arrays that need to be repaired.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.520
Get off my cheeks, Hugh!

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.520
Get off my cheeks, Gary.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.520
1891-C is back online.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.520
Back online.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.520
Hugh, by any chance, is it still Thursday?

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.520
It's been Thursday for the last 72 hours.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.520
Sweet. Then it's still on.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.520
My name is Eduardo Montaña Cariquinto de la Caparracaña.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.520
You killed my father. Prepare to die.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.520
Gary, your break is over.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.520
The guy who killed Eduardo Talaquinta Talapacian's father hasn't prepared to die yet.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.520
Dang, there's a... there's a pixel on the loose.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.520
It's a face-hater! It's a face-hater!

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.520
Oh, you're not a face-hater. You're a face-hugger.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.520
I need a face-hugger in my life.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.520
You remind me of a friend I used to have a long time ago.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.520
How do you like the name, Mooncake?

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.520
Mooncake it is.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.520
I'm pumped. Super excited. You know, by chance, I speak real words to you.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.520
Works for me.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.520
Welcome.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.520
Welcome.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.520
You're so tiny, man. What? Wait till the guys hear about this.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.520
Say it.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.520
Where is it?

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.520
What?

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.520
E35-1.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.520
I... I don't know. I would never lie to you, Lord Commander.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.520
It's just that you're so, so small. It's...

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.520
Where did you find it?

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.520
I didn't. It found me.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.520
The less you who between us is a bit of a dicklet wand knows about you, the better.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.520
Okay, let's get you in here. You ready?

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.520
Okay, it's not fitting. It's not working.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.520
I hide there sometimes. I'm like a mattress ghost. Don't tell anyone.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.520
Oh, perfect. No, it's not perfect. That sucks. Why does that suck so hard?

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:26.520
Okay, how about this? Sometimes I like to hide from myself by putting underwear on the circumference of my head.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.520
How about that? How's it fit? Perfect.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.520
Please don't kill me.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.520
Wouldn't think of it. That would be rude.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.520
Eat.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.520
What is going on? Why is the ship turned into a silent dance rave?

00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:02.520
Four unknown vessels are descending upon our location. The markings lead me to believe they are Ventraxian bounty hunters.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.520
Twist my nipples, Ruff. We're talking complex life forms. Yes, you.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.520
You must find out if they play cards. I need this. I need this, you. I... I really need somebody to play with.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.520
Activating security protocol.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.520
Hugh, what the crap?

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.520
For your own safety, you must remain in the commissary.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.520
For my own safety? We get our first visitors in five years and I can't mingle with them?

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.520
Hugh, open this door right now. I need to mingle.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.520
I'm afraid I cannot.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.520
You better afraid me up an open door.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.520
Ooh, let Kevin help.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.520
Goodbye, Kevin. You can just faint him up on me like that.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.520
Don't worry about me. I am helping.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.520
Kevin, you did something right.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.520
Kevin, you did something right.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.520
Kevin, you brought this horrendous death to Swede's?

00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:03.520
Your vessel has been subjected to a search for specimen E35-1. Come forward or die.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.520
Oh, crap.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.520
My arm, man!

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.520
Move forward.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.520
Who the freak is this guy?

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.520
I believe they want the alien you're hiding in your backpack.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.520
What? I don't know what you're referring to.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.520
This is what I was meant to do! I have never felt so alive!

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.520
Oh, you mean my underpants caddy!

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.520
Yes. We should comply with their wishes, Gary.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.520
I don't know. I kind of must be starting to like the little guy. He gives great hugs.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.520
Gary, we are not equipped to face this threat.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.520
Good job, avocado!

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.520
This is not our fight.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.520
Q, we make it our fight. You're Infinity Guard. Your whole motto is to protect life.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.520
Is that life, Gary?

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.520
Well, if it isn't, then I'm a raging sack of walnuts! Q, light-bolt the ship!

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.520
This will lengthen your sentence.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.520
I get it! Light-bolt the ship, you!

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.520
Gary!

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.520
Do it!

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.520
They're light-bolting!

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.520
They're light-bolting!

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.520
Proximity alert. Proximity alert.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.520
Is that what I think it is?

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.520
Q, that's no good! Get us out of here! Light-bolt again! Light-bolt! Light-bolt!

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.520
We are immobilized until the light-bolt engines cool.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.520
The asteroids will reach the ship in 29 seconds.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.520
Secure your helmet immediately.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.520
My helmet's in the airlock!

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.520
Run 15 seconds until impact. At your current pace, you will not make it.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.520
Oh, Gary will make it!

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.520
Hey, Gary, sorry. Got a minute?

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.520
Yeah, I've been thinking about this.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.520
Gary, two seconds.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.520
You're gonna live! You're gonna live!

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.520
Sweet, graduate stuff! Definitely gonna die this time!

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.520
Gary, you may have a problem.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:42.520
I seriously question your usage of mayhave! I think we have reached half! I am very deep in half!

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:50.520
Due to the moon's gravity, the asteroid field will swing back to the Galaxy 1, and then at you, in approximately 39 seconds.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.520
That's no good, Q! Formulate me up some solutions!

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.520
Calculating...

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.520
Ah, Gary, I do have a solution with a 33% chance of success.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.520
Okay, and that would be?

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.520
Perform an emergency air blowout of your O2 tanks.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.520
If you can enter the moon's orbit, you might be able to sling hook around it back to the Galaxy 1.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.520
All right. All right, let's do this.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.520
Gary, you should know, this calculation will only work with you.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.520
You will have to leave the lifeform behind.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.520
Mooncake?

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.520
Or, there is zero probability you will make it back to the Galaxy 1, alive.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.520
I get it! I'll screw them at you.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.520
Mooncake is coming with.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.520
You will never make it, Gary. Your only chance is to perform this maneuver alone.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.520
Q, your lack of confidence is positively depressing!

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.520
Blowing the air tank in three...

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.520
Gary, please.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.520
Two...

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.520
You will fail.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.520
You're right. I will fail. Upwards.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.520
Entering into moon's orbit.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.520
Oh no! It's not working!

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.520
At your current rate of velocity, you will not make it back to the Galaxy 1.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.520
You have failed, Gary.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.520
The asteroids will make impact in five seconds.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.520
Four...

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.520
Three...

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.520
Two...

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.520
One...

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.520
It worked!

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.520
You! And you said I could die! Ha!

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.520
You were dead for five minutes.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.520
Are you for serious?

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.520
I believe the lifeform saved your life.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.520
Mooncake?

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.520
Thank you for saving my life.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.520
I am detecting one unknown lifeform still aboard. He is armed.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.520
What dick!

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.520
Four-A, Sames are already en route.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.520
Hand over E-35-1.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.520
Listen, buddy. I only have one thing to say to you.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.520
Do you play cards?

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.520
I'm gonna take that as a yes!

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.520
Freeze!

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.520
Good lord!

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.520
Oh my gosh! Just to walk up on somebody like that, Hank?

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.520
But grab my pants!

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.520
Thought you were a baby ghost or a ghost baby!

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.520
Or something in between the ghost baby spectrum!

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.520
Freeze!

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.520
Freakin' crap, Hank!

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:11.520
Isn't this great? I mean, just us guys sitting here, chillin', playing cards.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.520
You really know how to swing the zinger, scat guy.

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.520
The name's Avocado.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.520
No. The name is Loser!

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.520
Eat it! Four of a kind!

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.520
You're oblivious to this thing, aren't you?

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.520
What? That. This? Yes. That.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.520
Mooncake? What's a mooncake? This! That? Yes, that.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.520
Please tell me you didn't name E-35-1.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.520
What's an E-35-59? That. This? Yes! Freakin' that!

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.520
I suppose I did.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.520
You don't know what that is, do you?

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.520
That is a planet killer.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.520
I hate this! Freakin' guy thinks mooncake's a planet killer!

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.520
What a freakin'... Oh, man!

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.520
Shut your face hole, Kevin! Crap!

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.520
So you think this is funny? I'm serious.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.520
Are you? Yes.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.520
The Lord Commander is searching the galaxy for it.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.520
You can't hide. Wherever you go, he'll find you.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.520
Why should I believe you, Mr. Whiskers?

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.520
Call me that again, and I'll kill you.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.520
Mm-hm. I've insulted you.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.520
You see, the truth is I've never socialized with a cat man before.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.520
My neighbor had a cat. Loved to lick himself.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.520
You're not gonna do that right.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.520
Otherwise, we're gonna have problems, friend.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.520
I'm not a cat. I'm a Ventrexian.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.520
Got it.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.520
See, I'm a Presbyterian myself.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.520
But I love all people. Just how I was raised.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:32.520
We're in danger. Listen, all of us are in danger!

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.520
Mooncake, look into Gary's gelatinous marbles.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.520
As long as I draw breath and you provide me with copious amounts of adventure,

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.520
I will be there for you. We're a team now.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.520
And I'll let you be my sidekick and such with a super sad order of whatnot.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.520
Well said.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.520
A cookie? For me?

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.520
Yes, Gary. Take one.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.520
You displayed a quality I hadn't seen in you previously.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.520
Courage. Exemplary. You earned it.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.520
And because I am the captain...

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.520
Cookie withdrawn.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.520
The penitent man shall pass.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.520
I got one! Sweet grandos clam! I got a mother-loving cookie!

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.520
This is a cookie, Gwen.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.520
You said I earned it.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.520
Because I did things, Gwen. Dangerous things.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.520
Cookie-earning things.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.520
Now, to eat the fruits of my greatness.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.520
Mine!

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.520
What? No!

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.520
Kevin! Oh, Kevin!

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:45.520
Gary. Gary. Gary. Gary. Gary. Gary. Gary. Are you sleeping?

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.520
What?

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.520
Oh, okay. We're good.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.520
Don't mind me. I'm just floating this way.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.520
This is the way I like to go. Bye!

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.520
This was my plan. That's my path.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.520
All the pieces are in place.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.520
Let's play a little.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.520
To be continued...
